I am an [associate professor](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/quesada-nicolas) at the Department of Physics of the [√âcole polytechnique de Montr√©al](https://www.polymtl.ca/) where I hold an MEI Research Chair in Quantum Photonics and lead the [Polyquantique Research Group](https://qpi.polymtl.ca). 

I am affiliated with two of [FRQNT](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/)'s Regroupements strat√©giques: [INTRIQ](https://www.intriq.org) and [COPL](https://coplweb.ca/). 

I am also a Senior Member of [Optica](https://www.optica.org/membership/distinguished_honorary/senior/senior_member_classes/2021_osa_senior_members_(1)/), a supporter of [The Cost of Knowledge](http://thecostofknowledge.com/) and a former editor of [Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/).

[My PhD](https://academictree.org/physics/tree.php?pid=164839) thesis on [Very Nonlinear Quantum Optics](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/71623) was completed at the University of Toronto.
