I am an [assistant professor](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/quesada-nicolas) at the Department of Engineering Physics of the [École Polytechnique de Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/) where I hold an MEI Research Chair in Quantum Photonics and lead the [Polyquantique Research Group](https://qpi.polymtl.ca). 

I am affiliated with two of [FRQNT](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/)'s Regroupements stratégiques: [INTRIQ](https://www.intriq.org) and [COPL](https://coplweb.ca/). 

I am also an editor of [Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/) and a Senior Member of [Optica](https://www.optica.org/membership/distinguished_honorary/senior/senior_member_classes/2021_osa_senior_members_(1)/).

I completed [my PhD](https://academictree.org/physics/tree.php?pid=164839) thesis on [Very Nonlinear Quantum Optics](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/71623) under the supervision of [Daniel F.V. James](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~dfvj/) and [J.E. Sipe](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~sipegroup/) at the University of Toronto. While in Toronto I was also a Vanier and Stoicheff Scholar and a Junior Fellow of [Massey College](https://www.masseycollege.ca). My [Erdős number is 4](https://www.csauthors.net/nicolas-quesada/).

I keep a collection of [miscellaneous useful links](./misc/).
